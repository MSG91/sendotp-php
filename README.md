## Set-up:

First of all, download the sdk by composer:

    composer require sendotp/sendotp

    or add this into your composer.json   
      "require": {
              "sendotp/sendotp": "^1.0"
          }


Then, require composer autoload and use package in your code:

    require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

    use sendotp\sendotp;

Once required, the last step is to initialize the SDK with your project name and project API Key:

    $otp = new sendotp('AUTK-KEY','Message Template : My otp is {{otp}}. Please do not share Me.');

That's all, your SDK is set up! You can now use any block by copying the code snippet from the marketplace.

## Usage:

    print_r($otp->send('91998153xxxx', 'MSGIND'));

The printed result will be:

    Array
    (
      [message] => 37646d6b7658303839363039
      [type] => success
      [otp] => 8227
    )
